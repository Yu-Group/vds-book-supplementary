The purpose of the assessor's office is \"discovering changes in real property, such as new construction, and maintaining the classification and values for the entire tax base of Ames\". To be eligible to be appointed an assessor in Iowa for a six-year term, one needs to pass a comprehensive examination. In order to be reappointed, \"150 hours of state-approved continuing education, of which at least 90 hours must be\n",

Since we did not want to bother the Assessor's Office for this educational example, and we won't be applying whatever algorithm we create in real life, we will still use this dataset for demonstration purposes, but we will make a compromise: we're going to use our imagination and *pretend that we live in the year 2011* (the year after De Cock's dataset ends)."

    "In order to do this, we need to be able to work with the sale date, which means that we need to use the `date` variable that we created when we cleaned the data. It is generally recommend to split your data into training, validation and test sets *before* applying your cleaning function to each dataset, this is mainly to avoid letting information from the training set bleed into the validation and test sets. This can happen, for instance, if you standardize the data using a standard deviation or another summary of a variable that makes use of all of the observations. However, this happens more often in pre-processing than cleaning (another reason why it often makes sense to have separate cleaning and pre-processing functions), and there is no risk of information bleeding with our cleaning function defined above (this won't always be the case, and you need to justify the validity of any modifications you make to your data prior to splitting).\n",

The option `simplify_vars=True` means we simplify the variables a lot, and `simplify_vars=False` means we simplify a little bit (for most of these variables, we have to perform *some* kind of simplification because the the downstream dummy variables that get created for rare levels can cause issues in our predictive algorithms). Specifically:\n",

Examples of this include the `roof_style` variable, the `electrical` variable, etc. We also provide an option specifically to do this for the `neighborhood` variable.\n",

Since this ordering is not encoded in the factor levels at all, it might make sense to convert these categories into ordered numbers, which might make it easier for the computer to interpret. We will provide three options for the `convert_categorical` argument: (1) `\"numeric\"` (convert to numeric), (2) `\"simplified_dummy\"` (convert to simplified dummy, e.g., lump \"excellent\" and \"good\" together, and lump \"fair\" and \"poor\" together, etc), (3) `\"dummy\"` (convert to regular dummy variables) and (4) `\"none\"` (leave as categorical).\n",
